## :beers: How to Build

First, Make sure you've installed these on your system:

- Xcode (recommended version: 16.3)
- NodeJS (recommended version: 24)

After cloning the Air repository, follow the build instructions and run:

```
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run build
npm run mobile:build
open mobile/ios/App/App.xcworkspace
```

Now, Build the project with Xcode as you normally would (and use Rosetta simulators if you encounter any issues). Happy coding! :)
If you've modified SDK files (src/api/*), please run the SDK file generator command:

```
npm run build:air
```

This command will generate the js file required in the Air applications and place it in the project directory automatically.

## SubModules

The Air application is splitted into many ui and logic submodules.

You can get a summary for submodules [here](docs/submodules.md).

If you want the dependency graph, visit [here](scripts/README.md).

## Blockchain Communications

All the api calls and blockchain logic is shared with our long-lived stable production webapp, through a js bridge. The native app is developed around that SDK.

To learn more about this bridge, read [this doc](docs/js-bridge.md).

## Storage

### Shared Storages:

* GlobalStorage

  Global storage stores all the non-critical data, including cached activities, settings and so on.

  It stores data in the web-view local-storage on both Legacy(Capacitor) app and the new Air(Native) app.

* SecureStorage

  Sensitive encrypted data are stored using this storage, into Keychain.

### Air Exclusive Storages:

* GRDB Sqlite DB

  Stores non-sensitive account data like account type, wallet name and so on. Used to handle unexpected localstorage removal.

* Logs

  Logs are stored in a .tsv file

* Nfts and Staking data

  Nfts and Staking data are stored in .json files
